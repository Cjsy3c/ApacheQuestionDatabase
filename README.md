ApacheQuestionDatabase

This is a question and answer service for the classroom. This program uses Java WAR files with apache Tomcat to serve the service. This application allows anyone to ask a question and for anyone to answer that question.


This was for an assignment in my database course. (Homework 4, question 4)

To run, place the WAR file inside of the webApps folder. Then start apache.
